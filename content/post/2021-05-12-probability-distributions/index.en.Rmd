# Probability Distributions
## In Persian

*How can we assess the validity of a claim?*  
*What is a random variable?*  
*What is the difference between continuous and discrete probability distributions?*

I've been asked these questions by my students a lot. So, I tried to explain it in detail. 
Unfortunately, Rmarkdown cannot support Persian text, so I'll translate this text to English as soon as possible.
