abstract: In  patients  with  renal  disorders,  a  sudden  decrease  in glomerular    filtration    rate    (GFR)    would    not    result    in    rapid    rise concentrations  of  Creatinine.  The  present  study  aimed  to  assess  diagnostic accuracy  of  serum  Cystatin  C  as  an  appropriate  alternative  to  serum Creatinine for early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).Materials and Methods:In this study, 72 patients,48 female and 24 male were selected. Serum Cystatin C and serum Creatinine were assayed, using enzyme-linked   immunosorbent   assay   (ELISA)   and   routine   methods, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated by Cockcroft and  Gault  formula.  Receiver  operating  characteristics  (ROC)  analysis  was adopted  to  evaluate  diagnostic  accuracy  of  serum  Cystatin  C  and  serum Creatinine.Results:Using    Pearson's    Correlation    Coefficient    analysis    among Creatinine, Cystatin C and eGFR showed Serum Cystatin C wasbetter than Creatinine. The sensitivity, specificity and AUC for Serum Cystatin C were 0.88,  0.70  and  0.85,  and  for  Serum  Creatinine,  they    were  0.60,  0.80  and 0.68 respectively.Conclusion:Our results showed that in early stages of CKD, Cystatin C is a more accurate biomarker for kidney function than Creatinine.
