Hi there, I'm <em>Navid</em>.<br>
I know biographies are boring, shameless exercises in self-adoration, so I don't dive deep. Just a few things about me:
<br> It's incredibly fulfilling to know that my life/work plays a part in assisting others, crafting tangible help, and impacting lives. </br>
Currently, immersing myself in the intricate world of <strong> Computational Mathematics and Statistics </strong> as a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.marquette.edu/">Marquette University</a>.
<br> I've got my master's degree in <strong>Biostatistics</strong> at <a href="https://en.sbmu.ac.ir/index.jsp?fkeyid=&siteid=256&pageid=2046">Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services</a>, the first-ranked university in my country in biostatistics. My thesis was about <a href="https://mejc.sums.ac.ir/article_47474.html#:~:text=Results%3A%20In%20noncured%20cases%2C%20the,%2C%20and%2080.7%25%2C%20respectively."><em>A cure rate survival model by using discrete frailty</em></a>. I also earned my bachelor's degree in <strong>Statistics</strong> from <a href="http://en.sbu.ac.ir/SitePages/Home.aspx">Shahid Beheshti University</a> in 2016. 
<br> In the professional realm, I've worn several hats: an independent data analyst working on various statistical projects, a researcher, and an instructor teaching R through workshops (e.g., my website is built with <em>R</em> and deployed with <em>Netlify</em>). My stint as a data analyst at <a href="https://www.tezolmarket.com/">TezolMarket</a> was particularly enlightening, as it involved tackling and resolving complex data challenges on a daily basis.
<br> Beyond the numbers and data, I have a deep-seated interest in <a href="https://500px.com/p/Navidmohseni?view=photos">photography</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54321599-navid-mohseni">books</a>, running, squash, and art. <br>
If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
<br> Thanks for visiting!
