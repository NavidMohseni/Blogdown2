Hi there, I'm <em><strong>Navid</strong></em>.<br>
I know biographies are boring, shameless exercises in self-adoration, so I don't dive deep. Just a few things about me:
<br> I'm enthusiastic about science and find meaning in my work when I know I'm helping people. 
Nothing lights me up like creating a solution that makes real change and enhances people's lives, and I find out that science is a great tool for that purpose. I have a passion for works that demand out-of-box solutions, creativity, creates bridges between seemingly disparate professional fields, and learning is an indispensable part of it. 
<br> I've got my master's degree in <strong>Biostatistics</strong> at <a href="https://en.sbmu.ac.ir/index.jsp?fkeyid=&siteid=256&pageid=2046">Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services</a>. My thesis was about <a href="https://mejc.sums.ac.ir/article_47474.html#:~:text=Results%3A%20In%20noncured%20cases%2C%20the,%2C%20and%2080.7%25%2C%20respectively."><em>A cure rate survival model</em></a>. I also earned my bachelor's degree in <strong>Statistics</strong> from <a href="http://en.sbu.ac.ir/SitePages/Home.aspx">Shahid Beheshti University</a> in 2016. 
<br> Alongside my friends, we've founded our business intelligence group, <a href="https://mayastat.ir/">MayaStat</a>, to help organizations to have data-driven decisions. Prior to that, I was working as an independent data analyst in statistical projects alongside doing research and teaching <em>R</em> by conducting workshops (e.g., my website is built with<em>R</em> and deployed with Netlify). Also, I was a data analyst at <a href="https://www.tezolmarket.com/">TezolMarket</a>, where we attempted to solve challenging data problems each day.
<br> I am also interested in <a href="https://500px.com/p/Navidmohseni?view=photos">photography</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54321599-navid-mohseni">books</a>, running, squash, and art. <br>
If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
<br> Thanks for visiting!
