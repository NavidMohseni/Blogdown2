Hi there, I'm Navid. I know Bios are boring, shameless exercises in self-adoration but as Carlos Scheidegger said, "if you don't have a website nowadays, you don't exist." 
<br> I'm enthusiastic about data science, machine learning, statistics, and data visualization. Actually, anything relates to math, numbers, and beautiful charts absorb me. I've got my master's degree in Biostatistics at <a href="https://en.sbmu.ac.ir/index.jsp?fkeyid=&siteid=256&pageid=2046">Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services</a>. I also earned my bachelor's degree in Statistics from <a href="http://en.sbu.ac.ir/SitePages/Home.aspx">Shahid Beheshti University</a> in 2016. 
<br> Recently, alongside my friends, we started a data science and analytics consulting service, <a href="https://mayastat.ir/">Maya-Stat</a>, to help organizations to have data-driven decisions. Prior to that, I was working as an independent data scientist in statistical projects alongside doing research and teaching R by conducting workshops. Also, I was a data analyst at <a href="https://www.tezolmarket.com/">TezolMarket</a>, where we attempted to solve challenging data problems each day. 
<br> I am also interested in <a href="https://500px.com/p/Navidmohseni?view=photos">photography</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54321599-navid-mohseni">books</a>, football, running, climbing, and anything relates to art. The point is: I see no contradiction between math and art. 
<br> My website is built with blogdown (R + Markdown + Hugo) and deployed with Netlify.
<br> If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
<br> Thanks for visiting!
